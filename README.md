# Assingment6MatrixAddition
 Assignment 6 for C++

6th Assingment for C++ class.  Was tasked to create a matrix class and overload addition("+") and stream insertion ("<<") operators.

Was to read in from a file the dimensions of matricies (rows and colums) the two different matricies from that file.

Was then tasked to use the main file to add the two matricies and output them only using the overloaded operators.
